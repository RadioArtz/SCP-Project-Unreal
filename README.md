# SCP: Project Unreal
 SCP: Project Unreal is an Unreal Engine recreation of the game [SCP: Containment breach](http://scpcbgame.com/)
 
 You can find the sourcecode of SCP: Containment Breach at https://github.com/Regalis11/scpcb.   
 There is also a rewrite to a custom engine in progress at https://github.com/juanjp600/scpcb

This is the open-source restart of development for SCP: Project Unreal.
The original version of this project was not set up with source control from the beginning and its codebase was too cluttered and lots of things had to be redone constantly which is why i decided to restart development from scratch.

#### Projectfile and contribution informations:
- this project uses a custom build of Unreal Engine 4.26, avaliable at https://github.com/IAAndrei/Unreal-Engine-Patched
- when working on some major system, create an issue to inform others that you are working on it and keep it updated if you stop working on it. This is to avoid two people spending a lot of time just to find out that someone else has been working on the same thing. You can of course still work on things that others are already working on if you want to.
- it was created without c++ enabled. I am open for c++ utilization, however I do not have the experience where i would feel comfortable enabling it by myself.
- **no external marketplace assets** are to be used!
- do NOT contribute assets and/or code that don't fall under the [License](https://github.com/RadioArtz/scp-project-unreal/blob/d0a3f758f9d75258092dbfb309da14a6c6b8ec47/License.txt)
